## How to use in game? ##
Look at a friendly revive marker and press R to start reviving. It'll keep reviving as long as you're close to it ( once you've started reviving, you don't necessarily need to keep looking at it ).


## Requirements ##
- [Stocksoup ( Compile Only )](https://github.com/nosoop/stocksoup)

## Installation ##
1. Grab the latest release from the release page and unzip it in your sourcemod folder.
2. Restart the server or type `sm plugins load AllClassReviveMarker` in the console to load the plugin.


## Convars ##
- **sm_allclassrevivemarker_revivedistance**: Dictates the maximum distance between the client and the revive marker while reviving.
- **sm_allclassrevivemarker_reviverate**: Dictates the amount of healing done every frame.

## Build ##
This plugin gets built by my other project [SPDependy](https://www.github.com/Zabaniya001/SPDependy)
